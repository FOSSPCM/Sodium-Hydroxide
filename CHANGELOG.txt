~~~CHANGELOG FOR THE SODIUM-HYDROXIDE TESTS~~~
Version 1.0 - July 24, 2024
	This is the initial release of the completed Sodium-Hydroxide tests for the web. It seems to work pretty good!
	
Version 1.0.1 - August 10, 2024
	Fixed a bug when testing for AAC-LC in ADTS containers.

Version 1.0.2 - November 16, 2024
	Added some links to ICC Version 4 color profiles tests and a link to a test for how well a browser can handle an image of arbitrary size (size as in dimensions, not in bytes).
	Removed the test for HLS. Media Source Extensions will cover this on its own.
	
Version 1.0.3 - November 18, 2024
	Fixed some bugs involving the WebAssembly test and removed some redundant code.
	
Version 1.0.4 - January 26, 2025
	Added tests for the DurationFormat, RelativeTimeFormat, Segmenter, and Segment objects in the International test.
	Added links to specifications for audio and video codecs that couldn't reliably be tested for automatically with JavaScript.
	Changed the links for MPEG specifications to the ISO specifications, as the MPEG links were merely technical whitepapers, not the specifications and ISO is the authoritative source for MPEG specs anyway.
	Did some code cleanup and fixed some grammatical errors.
