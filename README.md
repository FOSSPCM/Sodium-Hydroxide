# The Sodium-Hydroxide Tests

A test suite for web browsers that tests for support of various web standards, file formats, and privacy and security measures for the modern web.

## Tools used

HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript are what languages were used. Development was done in Notepad++ on Windows 10, and was tested primarily on Mozilla Firefox. This was also tested on Microsoft Edge, Opera, Pale Moon, and Ungoogled Chromium.

## How to run

Download all of the files, then with the browser you want to test, open "naoh.html" and the test will immediately run.

Open the console to see what tests your browser didn't pass or only passed in part.

Outside of that, treat it like any other website.
